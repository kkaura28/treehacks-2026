GEMINI OBSERVATIONS:
The procedure is a demonstration performed on a medical simulation model, not a live patient. The 'pus' is identified by the presenter as liquid butter. Several key steps, such as sterile skin preparation, local anesthesia, wound irrigation, packing, and dressing application, are not shown in this demonstration.
